## BIOGRAPHY

Prof. Haitao Zhao is a distinguished academic known for his contributions to the field of intelligent manufacturing and materials science. He obtained his BEng degree (First Class Honours) from Nanchang University in 2010, followed by an MSc and PhD from the University of Nottingham in 2011 and 2015, respectively. His academic journey includes significant positions at Zhejiang University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Currently, Prof. Zhao serves as a Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His research focuses on Materials Intelligent Manufacturing (MIM), integrating robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and data-driven methodologies. He aims to revolutionize traditional material R&D by developing Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS), powered by an advanced AI Engine. His overarching framework includes:

- Large language model-guided rational design ("Reading")  
- Automation-enabled controllable synthesis ("Doing")  
- AI agent-facilitated inverse design ("Thinking")  

to accelerate the creation of novel energy and semiconductor materials.

With over **100 peer-reviewed publications** (citations: **8167**, h-index: **52**, i10-index: **98**), Professor Zhao has authored ground-breaking papers such as:

- *â€˜A robotic platform for the synthesis of colloidal nanocrystalsâ€™* in **Nature Synthesis**  
- Invited review paper *â€˜Data-Driven Materials Innovation and Applicationsâ€™* in **Advanced Materials**

Professor Zhaoâ€™s research has led to the creation of two IEEE standards:

- **P3466** (Data-Driven High-throughput Laboratory Intelligence and Automation)  
- **P3467** (Digital Manufacturing and Stability Testing of Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules)

In addition to his academic work, Professor Zhao is the **founder and chair** of the *International Conference on Data-Driven Materials Innovation* and plays an active role in various professional societies and standardisation agencies, including:

- IEEE Smart Manufacturing Standards Committee  
- IEEE SA Regional Group of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area  
- Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Standard Innovation Alliance  

He is also a **Registered Senior Standardisation Engineer** in **Hong Kong** and **Guangdong Province**.

## RESEARCH CENTER

The **Research Centre for Materials Intelligent Manufacturing (RCMIM)** is dedicated to revolutionizing materials science through cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence and robotics.

> Artificial Intelligence is redefining the future of Physics and Chemistry.

Our mission is to establish an interdisciplinary technology (i.e., **Material Intelligence**) that focuses on enabling intelligent material synthesis through artificial intelligence and robotic infrastructure, similar to the way a scientistâ€™s mind and hands work â€” and even beyond.

By addressing the challenges through this unique interdisciplinary research (AI, robotics, and materials), **RCMIM** pioneers a transformative research framework focused on four core areas:

1. **Large language models guided rational design**  
   *(Extraction of synthesis formulas and parameters)*  
2. **Robotics-enabled controllable synthesis**  
   *(Execution of high-throughput synthesis and in-situ characterization)*  
3. **A domain-specific model facilitated learning and generating**  
   *(Evolution of synthesis formulas and parameters)*  
4. **Embodied intelligence-powered autonomous cycles of Extraction-Execution-Evolution**

The proposed **4E techniques** (*Extraction, Execution, Evolution, and Embodied intelligence*) will establish an infrastructure of **Material Intelligence** to significantly improve the level of precision in material synthesis and intelligence in interdisciplinary research.
