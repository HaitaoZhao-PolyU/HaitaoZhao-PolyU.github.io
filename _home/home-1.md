Prof. Haitao Zhao is a distinguished academic known for his contributions to the field of intelligent manufacturing and materials science. He obtained his BEng degree (First Class Honours) from Nanchang University in 2010, followed by an MSc and PhD from the University of Nottingham in 2011 and 2015, respectively. His academic journey includes significant positions at Zhejiang University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Currently, Prof. Zhao serves as a Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His research focuses on Materials Intelligent Manufacturing (MIM), integrating robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and data-driven methodologies. He aims to revolutionize traditional material R&D by developing Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS), powered by an advanced AI Engine. His overarching framework includes large language model-guided rational design ("Reading"), automation-enabled controllable synthesis ("Doing"), and AI agent-facilitated inverse design ("Thinking") to accelerate the creation of novel energy and semiconductor materials.

With over 100 peer-reviewed publications (citations: 8167, h-index: 52, i10-index: 98), Professor Zhao has authored ground-breaking paper such as ‘A robotic platform for the synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals’ in Nature Synthesis and invited review paper such as ‘Data-Driven Materials Innovation and Applications’ in Advanced Materials. Professor Zhao’s research has led to the creation of two IEEE standards: P3466 (Data-Driven High-throughput Laboratory Intelligence and Automation) and P3467 (Digital Manufacturing and Stability Testing of Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules). In addition to his academic work, Professor Zhao is the founder and chair of the International Conference on Data-Driven Materials Innovation and plays an active role in various professional societies and standardisation agencies, including the IEEE Smart Manufacturing Standards Committee, IEEE SA Regional Group of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Standard Innovation Alliance. He is also a Registered Senior Standardisation Engineer in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province.
