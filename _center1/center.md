## About Research Centre for Materials Intelligent Manufacturing

The Research Centre for Materials Intelligent Manufacturing (RCMIM) is dedicated to revolutionizing traditional material R&D through cutting-edge interdisciplinary research of material intelligence by artificial intelligence and robotics. The overarching framework includes large language models guided rational design (‘Extraction’), robotics-enabled controllable synthesis (‘Execution’), a domain-specific model facilitated learning and generating (‘Evolution’) and embodied intelligence powered autonomous cycles of Extraction-Execution-Evolution, to accelerate the creation of novel materials （energy materials, civil engineering materials，semiconducting material, superconducting materials, etc. with foucing on formulas and parameters）

“To achieve **Material Intelligence**, we begin with the power of **Artificial Intelligence**—harnessing its ability to learn and generate complex material formulas and synthesis parameters. From the cyber world to the physical world, **Machine Intelligence** evolves into **Embodied Intelligence** through the convergence of Artificial Intelligence and robotics, endowing Material Intelligence with unique capabilities for autonomous high-throughput synthesis and in situ characterization. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve **code to materials** via Materials Intelligent Manufacturing.”  – Professor Haitao ZHAO
